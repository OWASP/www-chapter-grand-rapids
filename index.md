## Welcome
Welcome to the OWASP Grand Rapids chapter homepage. This GitHub repository is our central source of information about our chapter. We are a small but growing group of technology enthusiasts, IT professionals, and those with a passion to learn about and improve security practices. The Grand Rapids chapter is a small and local part of the larger OWASP mission of achieving community around the world.

## Participation
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

The Grand Rapids chapter is organized by leaders in accordance with the [Chapter Leader Handbook](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and then contact our chapter with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.
